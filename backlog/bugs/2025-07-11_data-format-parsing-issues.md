# Task: Fix Data Format and Parsing Issues in Dataset Loading

## Description

Several datasets have data format and parsing issues that cause test failures. These include malformed CSV files and invalid YAML content that need to be addressed.

**Affected Tests:**
1. `test_football_data_dimensions` - CSV parsing error with `<HEAD>` string that can't convert to float64
2. `test_pmlr_dimensions` - YAML parsing error with invalid character `#x0008` (backspace) in YAML file

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `test_football_data_dimensions` passes without CSV parsing errors
- [ ] `test_pmlr_dimensions` passes without YAML parsing errors
- [ ] All CSV files are properly formatted and parseable
- [ ] All YAML files are valid and parseable
- [ ] Data loading functions handle malformed data gracefully
- [ ] Error handling is improved for data parsing failures

## Implementation Notes

**Issues identified:**

1. **Football Data CSV Issue:**
   - Problem: CSV contains `<HEAD>` string that can't convert to float64
   - Location: Likely in downloaded CSV file
   - Solution: Clean the CSV data or add data validation/cleaning logic

2. **PMLR YAML Issue:**
   - Problem: Invalid character `#x0008` (backspace) in YAML file
   - Location: `/pmlr/v263/assets/bib/citeproc.yaml` at position 7468
   - Solution: Clean the YAML file or add YAML validation/cleaning logic

**Implementation approaches:**
1. Add data validation and cleaning in dataset loading functions
2. Update data files to remove malformed content
3. Add error handling for parsing failures
4. Consider using more robust parsing libraries

**Files to investigate:**
- Football data CSV files
- PMLR YAML files
- Dataset loading functions in `pods/datasets.py`
