# Task: Fix Test Framework Configuration and Fixture Issues

## Description

There is a pytest configuration issue where the `test_dataset_dimensions` function is missing a required fixture. This appears to be a test framework configuration problem that needs to be resolved.

**Affected Test:**
- `test_dataset_dimensions` - Missing fixture 'dataset_name' not found

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `test_dataset_dimensions` function has proper pytest configuration
- [ ] All required fixtures are properly defined and available
- [ ] Test generation logic works correctly for all datasets
- [ ] No pytest fixture errors occur during test execution
- [ ] All generated dataset tests run successfully

## Implementation Notes

**Current issue:**
The `test_dataset_dimensions` function in `pods/testing/datasets_tests.py` is being generated dynamically but may not be properly configured as a pytest test.

**Investigation needed:**
1. Review the test generation logic in `datasets_tests.py`
2. Check if pytest fixtures are properly defined
3. Verify that dynamically generated test functions are compatible with pytest
4. Ensure test function signatures match pytest expectations

**Files to investigate:**
- `pods/testing/datasets_tests.py`
- `pyproject.toml` (pytest configuration)
- Any pytest configuration files

**Potential solutions:**
1. Add proper pytest decorators to generated test functions
2. Define missing fixtures
3. Restructure test generation to be more pytest-friendly
4. Add explicit test function registration
